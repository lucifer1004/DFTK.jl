    "# Saving SCF results on disk and SCF checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "For longer DFT calculations it is pretty standard to run them on a cluster\n",
    "in advance and to perform postprocessing (band structure calculation,\n",
    "plotting of density, etc.) at a later point and potentially on a different\n",
    "machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support such workflows DFTK offers the two functions `save_scfres`\n",
    "and `load_scfres`, which allow to save the data structure returned\n",
    "by `self_consistent_field` on disk or retrieve it back into memory,\n",
    "respectively. For this purpose DFTK uses the\n",
    "[JLD2.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JLD2.jl) file format and Julia package.\n",
    "For the moment this process is considered an experimental feature and\n",

    "    The `load_scfres` and `save_scfres` pair of functions\n",

    "    - JLD2 is not yet completely matured\n",
    "      and it is recommended to only use it for short-term storage\n",
    "      and **not** to archive scientific results.\n",
    "    - If you are using the functions to transfer data between different\n",
